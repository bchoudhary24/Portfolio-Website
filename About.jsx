            Hello! I'm <strong>Bhumika Choudhary</strong>, a passionate Web Developer, Tech Enthusiast, and Public Speaker.
            I specialize in building user-friendly, high-performance websites and web apps using modern technologies like React, Node.js, and Tailwind.
          </p>
<br />
          <p>
            I'm currently pursuing B.Tech from Kothiwal Institute of Technology and Professional Studies. I've built several projects including a
            <em> Netflix Clone</em>, <em>TODO App</em>, and even my <em>college's website</em> — all as real-world applications using React.
          </p>
<br />
          <p>
            I believe in continuous learning, building in public, and solving real-world problems through tech. My dedication to writing clean, scalable code and exploring emerging trends sets me apart as a modern developer.
          </p>
